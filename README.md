# The VBA of Wall Street

Don’t know a Blue Chip from a Penny Stock? That’s ok, neither do most people! Thanks to the brand new VBA code, anyone with Microsoft Excel can sort through years of stock data to pull relevant information including the Ticker Symbol, Yearly change in Opening and Closing prices for stocks, percent changes for opening and closing prices over a year and Total Stock Volume. It can even loop through multiple worksheets in a single use. Are you having as difficult a time as I am even knowing what to do with this information? That’s alright! This VBA also conditionally the results to highlight positive change in and negative change in red, so all can follow and you’ll feel like the TED Speaker of your weekly Sales Meeting.

## Installation

None required! All that’s needed is the VBA code, Microsoft Excel and the stock information you’d like analyzed.

## Usage

Just copy and paste the code into a Visual Basic module through the developer tab. Results will be outputted to the active worksheets.
